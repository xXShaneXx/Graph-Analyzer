# Polynomial Network Analyzer

This project is a Python application that uses a Polynomial Network to analyze and fit a polynomial to a set of data points. The application provides a GUI for users to interact with the data and the Polynomial Network.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive GUI for data input and visualization
- Polynomial Network for data analysis
- Customizable parameters for the Polynomial Network
- Real-time data and analysis visualization

## 📦 Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:

```bash
contourpy==1.2.1
cycler==0.12.1
fonttools==4.52.1
kiwisolver==1.4.5
matplotlib==3.9.0
numpy==1.26.4
packaging==24.0
pillow==10.3.0
pyparsing==3.1.2
python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
six==1.16.0
```
## 🛠️ Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎮 Usage

To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
make run
```
In the GUI, you can click and drag on the plot to add data points. You can then adjust the parameters of the Polynomial Network and click "Analyze" to fit a polynomial to the data. The fitted polynomial and its equation will be displayed on the plot and in the GUI, respectively.

##🧹 Cleaning Up

To clean up the project (e.g., remove Python cache files), run the following command:
```bash
make clean
```
